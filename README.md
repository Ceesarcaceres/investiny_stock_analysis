# investiny_stock_analysis

Using the API Investiny that receive data from Investing.com to analysis a historical data from HTMX11, a investiment fund from exchange BM&FBOVESPA
that I currently invest.

I like very much analysing and studing about stocks prices, and I present this analysis in my github.
